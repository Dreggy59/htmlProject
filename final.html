    <hr>
    <p>With the Infinity Stones collected, the Avengers build a new gauntlet. <br> 
        Hulk uses it to reverse Thanos' snap, bringing back everyone who was lost. <br>
        However, past Thanos discovers their plan and attacks the Avengers' base, leading to an all-out war.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Thanos battles Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor in a brutal fight.</li>
        <li>Captain America lifts Mjolnir, proving himself worthy, and briefly gains the upper hand.</li>
        <li>Thanos overwhelms them and calls in his massive army, outnumbering the Avengers.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Just as hope seems lost, Doctor Strange and other heroes return through portals, bringing allies from across the universe to stand against Thanos.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Wakandan warriors, sorcerers, and Asgardians join the fight.</li>
        <li>Spider-Man swings into action, reuniting with Iron Man.</li>
        <li>Captain Marvel arrives, destroying Thanos' ship in a powerful display.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the climactic moment, Thanos gets his hands on the gauntlet, <br>
        but Iron Man manages to take the Stones. In a heroic sacrifice, <br>
        Iron Man snaps his fingers, turning Thanos and his army to dust.</p>
    <p>The battle ends, but Iron Man dies from his injuries, <br> 
        leaving the Avengers mourning their friend. The universe is saved, but at the cost of those they loved.</p>
