            <h3>Name: Dregg Raul C. Cabansay</h3>
            <h3>Age: 18 years old</h3>
            <h3>Location: Deca Homes, Tunghaan, Minglanilla</h3>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated and motivated individual who is passionate about technology, creativity, and learning. 
                <br>My interests span a wide range of activities that help me grow both personally and intellectually.
            </p>
            <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Watching anime (One Piece, Bleach, Seven Deadly Sins)  I love exploring complex characters and epic storylines. Anime is not just entertainment for me; it’s a source of inspiration and life lessons.</li>
                <li>Listening to music (hip-hop, country, rap)  Music fuels my creativity and helps me stay focused. Whether I’m working or relaxing, there’s always a perfect track to accompany the moment.</li>
                <li>Playing online games  Gaming allows me to strategize, think critically, and connect with friends. It's also a great way to unwind after a tiring day.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I am always looking for ways to improve myself, whether it’s through learning new skills, exploring different cultures, or challenging myself to step out of my comfort zone. 
                <br>In every challenge, I believe there is an opportunity for growth, and I strive to approach each one with determination and optimism.
            </p>

            <h3>
                One of my core beliefs is captured in my favorite saying: "As long as I live, there are infinite chances." This quote by Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece resonates with me deeply, as it reflects my outlook on life. No matter the obstacles, I believe in the endless possibilities to achieve my goals and dreams.
            </h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                In the future, I hope to apply my passion for technology and creativity to make a meaningful impact in the field I choose. I am always excited to collaborate with others, share ideas, and create something impactful.
